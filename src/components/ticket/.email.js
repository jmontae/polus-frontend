   Description:Hi Charlotte and ATEC team, 
    
   The professor teaching in ATC 3.205 on Fridays at 2:30, 4 and again 5:30, says the noise coming from the Waterhole/chat hour is drowning out his classroom lessons. He has asked the participants in the Waterhole chat hour to please keep the noise level down while class is in session, but to no avail. 
    
   I have a few ideas to help resolve the situation: 
    
   1.     Can the Waterhole chat hour move into a lab, office, empty classroom, or one of the rooms in ATEC meant for meetings? 
   2.     Or perhaps use one of the open spaces on the first floor?
   3.     Can the Waterhole chat hour be moved to a different time, so that the lively discussion doesn’t impact the classrooms in that hallway? 
    
   This Fall, classes in ATC 3.205 are in session until 6:45 PM but in the Spring, the last class is over at 5:15 PM, if that helps. 
    
   Thanks for your help in coming up with a solution.
